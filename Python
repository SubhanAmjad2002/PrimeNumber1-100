# A number should not be divisible on any number other than itself.
# I was working on a solution to make it O(N) solution in terms of time complexity.
# To achieve this i have append 1 to 10 prime numbers statically in list.
# On next step i have loop through 10 to 100 and put a condition if a number is not multiple of 2 , 3 , 5 and 7 then count it as prime number and append in prime_number list.
prime_number = []
prime_number.append(2)
prime_number.append(3)
prime_number.append(5)
prime_number.append(7)
for i in range(10,100):
    if(i%2 != 0 and i%3 != 0 and i%5 != 0 and i%7 != 0):
        prime_number.append(i)
print(prime_number);
